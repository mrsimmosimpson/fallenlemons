I've just spent 6 weeks at [The Garden](www.thegarden.pt), a 20-acre forest in Portugal with a bunch of smart, kind, open-minded weirdos; musicians, dancers, artists and entrepreneurs. 


If I thought [my three months there last year shot my journey towards secure attachment](https://simmosimpson.substack.com/p/finding-self-sovereignty) to a whole new level, this year may have finally laid my anxious attachment to rest (more on that in a future post).


I'm now at the [Fool's Valley community](https://foolsvalley.com/) near Lisbon for the first week or so of a little residency called Wholesome Realms. Mainly I'm decompressing after 2 months of intense connection, crushes, romances and deep healing.

My main intention this week was to get this site up and running. âœ…Done!


Now I want to write. It's become one of my primary methods for clarifying my thinking and consolidating my growth.  It might be the case that more powerful shifts have happened for me these last few months than any equivalent period in the last decade. 


And I want to work out how to use this digital scrapbook. This is my first attempt.


**In that vein, here are some photos from Fool's Valley**
