[[Fallen Lemons]] (digital scrapbook)

**#### Hi, I’m Simmo


Sometimes life coach, relational facilitator, musician and obsessive in the arts of relational attunement, connection, community and other such things in the pantry of nourishing human connection. 


This site is brand new (as of August 2025). The intention is for it to be a digital scrapbook; a place to post *things in progress*. Fallen lemons yet to make it from the ground and into the lemon pie. 

Finished pies and lemonade will make it to other platforms to be shared in all their glory. But here, you may stumble upon my lately half-formed ideas, writing, musical meanderings and visual vignettes
