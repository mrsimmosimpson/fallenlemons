**Hi, I’m Simmo**!

<p align="center"> ![[Pasted image 20250818223830.png|400]] </p>

*Still figuring out how to build this site... photo to be resized!*


Sometimes life coach, relational facilitator and musician, I am an obsessive in the arts of relational attunement, community and other such things in the pantry of nourishing human connection. 


This site is brand new (as of August 2025). The main intention is for it to host [[Fallen Lemons]], my digital scrapbook; a place to post *things in progress*. The fruit, still sour and under-processed, yet to make it from the ground and into the lemon pie. 


And since I build this, I decided to host some resources too. Currently the resources is just my master list of communities; the one that every community interested person I mention it to wants.


Finished pies and lemonade will make it to [other platforms](https://www.simmosimpson.com/Links) to be shared in all their glory. But here, you may stumble upon the tasting menu of my new musings, lately half-formed ideas, writing, musical meanderings and visual vignettes.
